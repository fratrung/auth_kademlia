# AuthKademlia-RS

A Rust reimplementation of [AuthKademlia](https://github.com/fratrung/AuthKademlia) — an extended Kademlia Distributed Hash Table with native support for **signed records** and **Verifiable Data Registry (VDR)** capabilities for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).

-----

## Overview

AuthKademlia-RS is a high-performance, asynchronous implementation of the [Kademlia DHT protocol](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf) written in Rust. It extends the standard Kademlia specification with cryptographic record signing, making it suitable for use as a decentralized identity infrastructure layer.

Unlike conventional DHT implementations, AuthKademlia-RS treats stored values as **verifiable artifacts**: each record is cryptographically bound to its author and can be independently verified by any node in the network — without any central authority.

-----

## Why Rust for the DHT Core?

The original [AuthKademlia](https://github.com/fratrung/AuthKademlia) is written in Python, and the application-layer logic (provisioning, REST APIs, orchestration) intentionally remains in Python. The DHT node core, however, has been reimplemented in Rust to address a fundamental constraint: **post-quantum signature verification is CPU-bound, and the Python GIL serialises all CPU-bound work to a single thread regardless of how many cores are available**.

### The GIL bottleneck on CPU-bound workloads

Python's **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** permits only one thread to execute bytecode at a time. For I/O-bound tasks this is rarely a bottleneck, but Dilithium-2 signature verification is purely computational. In CPython, even with `threading` or `asyncio`, all verification calls are serialised to one core:

```
Python (N cores):  throughput ≈ 1 core × ops/s        (GIL ceiling)
Rust   (N cores):  throughput ≈ N cores × ops/s        (true parallelism)
```

This gap widens on hardware with slower per-core performance, which is common in embedded and edge deployments where power and cost constraints favour multi-core low-frequency processors over single-core speed. The Python implementation would leave most available compute idle; the Rust implementation uses every core.

### Layered architecture via PyO3

The Python binding (built with [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) via PyO3) releases the GIL before entering Rust code. This means:

- The **application layer stays in Python** — no rewrite required for existing tooling.
- The **DHT hot path (store, get, signature verification)** runs in Rust across all available cores with zero GIL contention.
- The performance gap between the two implementations grows proportionally with the number of cores and with the cost of the cryptographic primitive — both of which favour Rust in production deployments.

|Feature                  |Standard Kademlia|AuthKademlia-RS                     |
|-------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|
|Record integrity         |None             |Cryptographic signature verification|
|Identity support         |None             |Native DID Document storage         |

|Language                 |Various          |Rust (memory-safe, high-performance)|

-----

## Signed Records and Verifiable Data Registry

Each value stored in the DHT is a **structured signed record** with the following layout:

```
algorithm (12 bytes) | signature | DID Document (canonical JSON)
```

This structure allows any peer to:

- Verify the **authenticity** of stored data using the public key embedded in the DID Document
- Verify the **integrity** of the record against its signature
- Operate without trusting any single node or coordinator

Signature validation is handled automatically by the integrated verifier at insertion and retrieval time.

-----

## Network Layer & Application-Level Fragmentation

Since Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) records—containing Dilithium signatures and Kyber keys—often exceed the standard UDP MTU, **AuthKademlia-RS** implements a custom application-level fragmentation and reassembly system.

This ensures that messages remain within safe network limits, avoiding unreliable IP-level fragmentation and improving delivery rates across different network topologies.

### The Message Pipeline

When a node publishes or retrieves a record, the data passes through a structured lifecycle:

1.  **Serialize**: The record is serialized using `bincode` for high-performance binary encoding.
2.  **Split**: The payload is split into chunks of up to **1400 bytes** each, every chunk prefixed with a `KADF` header. A typical Dilithium-2 record (~6 KB) produces 5 fragments.
3.  **Send**: Fragments are transmitted independently from sender to receiver.
4.  **Recv**: The receiver populates a `ReassemblyMap` keyed by `(peer_addr, frag_id)`; slots fill as fragments arrive.
5.  **Assemble**: Once all fragments are received, they are concatenated in index order.
6.  **Dispatch**: The reassembled payload is deserialized and dispatched (e.g. `rpc_store()`), followed by cryptographic signature verification.
7.  **Response**: A result message is sent back to the sender to acknowledge the operation.

### Wire Format

Each UDP datagram sent by this layer has the following layout (all multi-byte integers big-endian):

```
[magic: 4 B "KADF"][frag_id: 4 B u32][index: 2 B u16][total: 2 B u16][payload: variable]
```

Total header: **12 bytes**. `frag_id` is unique per logical message per sender. `index` is 0-based; `total` is the number of fragments (≥ 1). When `total == 1` the datagram carries the entire frame.

By inspecting fragments you can identify the internal composition of a PQC record:
* **Dilithium-2 signature** (2420 B): spans roughly the first two fragments.
* **DID Document JSON** (with base64-encoded Kyber/Dilithium public keys): in the remaining fragments.

## Performance & Concurrency

| Mechanism | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Concurrent storage** | `DashMap` replaces `IndexMap + RwLock`. Storage operations on different keys are fully parallel with no single global lock. |
| **Lazy TTL expiry** | Expired entries are filtered at read time instead of an O(n) scan on every write. |
| **Signature cache** | `SignatureCache` (moka, SHA-256 keyed, TTL 1 h, 4096 entries). Repeated reads of the same record pay full Dilithium cost only once; subsequent reads are O(1). Any byte-level change forces full re-verification. |
| **Worker pool** | UDP receive loop dispatches via round-robin into `available_parallelism()` workers, each with a dedicated `mpsc::channel(256)`. `try_send` is attempted on each worker in turn; if all are full the loop awaits the base worker, providing backpressure without drops. |
| **Fire-and-forget routing** | Routing table updates (`welcome_if_new`) are spawned as background tasks in all RPC handlers. RPC responses are sent immediately without waiting for routing convergence. |
| **Replication filter** | On node join, only nodes XOR-closer to a key than the new node replicate it (Kademlia §2.5). Prevents redundant store RPCs from far-away nodes. |
| **Atomic insert** | `rpc_store` uses a DashMap `Entry`-based `insert_if_absent` — eliminates the TOCTOU race window that existed with the old read-then-write pattern. |

-----

## Concurrency Architecture

AuthKademlia-RS uses a two-layer concurrency model that separates
**async I/O** (Tokio tasks) from **CPU-bound work** (OS blocking threads).
Understanding the distinction matters on embedded hardware where both
cores and memory are scarce.

### Thread types

| Type | Created by | Scheduled by | Count | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Worker thread** (OS) | Tokio runtime at startup | Kernel | `available_parallelism()` | Executing async tasks |
| **Blocking thread** (OS) | Tokio on-demand | Kernel | ≤ `available_parallelism()` | Dilithium verification |
| **Task** (coroutine) | `tokio::spawn` | Tokio scheduler | Many | All async logic |

Worker threads and blocking threads are real OS threads visible to the
kernel. Tasks are lightweight state machines allocated on the heap —
they have no dedicated OS thread and consume no CPU when suspended on
`.await`.

### Runtime layout

```
Hardware proxy (N cores)
│
├─ Tokio worker threads  [OS threads, N = available_parallelism()]
│   Each runs a loop:  pick next ready task → poll it → repeat
│   Tasks yield at every .await, freeing the thread immediately.
│
└─ Tokio blocking pool  [OS threads, max = available_parallelism()]
    Created on-demand for spawn_blocking (Dilithium verify/sign).
    Capped via max_blocking_threads() — see runtime configuration.
```

### UDP receive pipeline

```

                        │   task completes, returns to rx.recv()

                              spawn_blocking(Dilithium)
                              .await  ← task suspended, worker thread FREE
                                          │
                                          ▼
                                    Blocking OS thread
                                    Dilithium verify  (~5–50 ms on ARM)
                                          │
                                          ▼
                              task resumes on any free worker thread
                              storage.insert_if_absent()
                              send_frame(response)
```

**Key property:** when a worker task suspends on `.await` — waiting for
a channel, a lock, a network reply, or a blocking thread — the OS thread
that was executing it is immediately reused for another task. At any
given instant, the number of OS threads in use never exceeds
`worker_threads + max_blocking_threads = 2 × available_parallelism()`.

### Backpressure

When all worker channels are full (all workers busy, all queues at 256
entries) the recv loop suspends on `channel.send().await` instead of
dropping the datagram or spawning an unbounded number of tasks. The
system slows down gracefully under burst load without packet loss or
memory growth.

```
Normal load:   recv_from → try_send → Ok  (O(1), no allocation)
Burst load:    recv_from → try_send → Err (all full)
                         → send().await   (recv loop suspended)
                         ← worker drains one slot
                         → resumes, inserts datagram
```

### Signature cache interaction

The `SignatureCache` (moka, SHA-256 keyed, TTL 1 h) lifts most GET
operations entirely out of the blocking pool:

```
GET cold:  SHA-256(record) → cache miss → spawn_blocking(Dilithium) → cache.insert
GET warm:  SHA-256(record) → cache hit  → return immediately  (no blocking thread)
```

On a proxy that authenticates the same devices repeatedly, the warm
path dominates and the blocking pool stays nearly idle.

-----

## Throughput & Benchmarks

### Throughput limits

Each `set` → `get` round-trip includes a full Dilithium-2 signature verification
(~5 ms CPU time on a modern x86 core). Peak verification throughput scales linearly
with core count — approximately `N_cores / 5 ms` unique verifications per second.

The `SignatureCache` substantially raises the practical ceiling: once a record has
been verified once, subsequent reads return the cached result in O(1) time with no
blocking work.

### Signature cache benchmark

`examples/cache_bench.rs` measures two isolated phases:

- **Phase 1 — DHT SET throughput**: two sequential clusters (cached vs uncached) running real network operations with no CPU contention between them.
- **Phase 2 — Signature verification micro-benchmark**: records injected directly into local storage, sequential `get()` calls, zero network variance. Isolates the exact Dilithium-2 vs cache-hit cost.

The expected behaviour:
- *GET cold*: cache miss → SHA-256(record) + `moka.get()` miss + `spawn_blocking(Dilithium-2)` + `moka.insert()`. The SHA-256 overhead is small relative to Dilithium (~5 ms); on first read the cached node pays a marginal extra cost.
- *GET warm*: cache hit → SHA-256(record) + `moka.get()` → result returned immediately. No blocking work. Speedup is proportional to the Dilithium-2 cost on the target hardware.
- *DHT SET*: dominated by network round-trip; cache has negligible effect on write throughput.

Run `cargo run --release --example cache_bench` to collect measurements on your
own hardware (fixed at 10 000 ops, c=30 for DHT SET; 500 ops sequential for the
micro-benchmark). The cache can be disabled per-node by passing `use_cache: false`
to `Server::new` for benchmarking or security auditing.

### Routing topology diagnostic

`examples/topology_analysis.rs` builds an in-process cluster of N nodes, stores M records, then emits eight diagnostic sections that verify Kademlia routing correctness without any mocks:

| Section | What it checks |
|---|---|
| **Node discovery** | Each node lists the peers it found after bootstrapping |
| **Routing table size** | Peer count per node — confirms convergence |
| **Sample DID Documents** | 3 raw records stored in the DHT |
| **Storage per node** | Which keys each node holds |
| **Replication summary** | Copy-count distribution across the cluster |
| **XOR correctness** | For each sampled record: are the k XOR-closest nodes the ones actually storing it? |
| **Bucket structure** | Per-node bucket tree — index, node count, depth, fresh/lonely, range start |
| **Flat routing tables** | Full peer list per node with IP:port |

The XOR-correctness check is the key invariant: it sorts all nodes by XOR distance to each record's key and verifies that the k-closest nodes are the holders. Each record is labelled `[✓]` (all k-closest hold it), `[~]` (partial), or `[✗]` (none of the k-closest hold it).

```bash
# k=3 replication factor, 30 nodes, 100 records (default)
cargo run --release --example topology_analysis -- 3 30

# smaller cluster for quick inspection
cargo run --release --example topology_analysis -- 3 10
```

The bucket-structure section also reports convergence quality: average buckets per node should approach log₂(N) for a well-converged cluster.

### Resilience &amp; robustness tests (Docker)

`resilience/` contains three Docker-based scenarios that measure crash resistance,
security invariants, and performance degradation under adversarial load.
Node A is capped at **2 CPU cores / 256 MB RAM** to simulate a constrained
embedded edge device; Node B is unconstrained so it can fully saturate Node A's
CPU budget.

| Scenario | Tool | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Single adversarial run | `docker compose up --build` | Verify security invariants and basic survivability |
| Statistical benchmark | `run_stats.py` | N runs with mean, std, and Student-t confidence intervals |
| Degradation sweep | `degradation_sweep.py` | Acceptance rate, p95 latency and throughput vs attacker concurrency |

```bash
cd resilience

# single run
docker compose up --build

# 10-run statistical analysis (95 % CI)
python3 run_stats.py --no-build

# degradation curve across concurrency levels
python3 degradation_sweep.py --no-build
```

See **[`resilience/README.md`](resilience/README.md)** for full documentation:
test methodology, metric definitions, expected degradation behaviour, environment
variables, and output format.

**Why Docker and not a single-process benchmark:** attacker and victim running in the
same process share a Tokio runtime, so the attacker's CPU load directly degrades the
victim's async executor — not a realistic model. Separate containers give each node
its own runtime and let the OS scheduler arbitrate CPU time fairly, while
`deploy.resources.limits.cpus` constrains Node A independently of Node B.

## DID:IIoT Integration

This implementation is designed to interoperate with the [`did:iiot` method](https://github.com/fratrung/did-iiot), an open DID method targeting **Industrial IoT** environments.

DID Documents stored in the DHT embed **post-quantum public keys** (Dilithium for authentication, Kyber for key exchange), enabling:

- Secure device authentication
- Post-quantum key exchange
- Verifiable credential issuance and resolution

A complete end-to-end integration example is available at [fratrung/did-iiot-dht](https://github.com/fratrung/did-iiot-dht).

## Tokio runtime configuration

`auth_kademlia_rs` does not create a Tokio runtime — the caller owns it. Dilithium-2
verification is CPU-bound and runs on Tokio's blocking thread pool via `spawn_blocking`.
On embedded hardware (2–4 core ARM SoCs) the default pool cap of 512 threads causes
unnecessary context-switching overhead. Cap it to the number of physical cores:

```rust
fn main() {
    let parallelism = std::thread::available_parallelism()
        .map(|p| p.get())
        .unwrap_or(4);
    tokio::runtime::Builder::new_multi_thread()
        .max_blocking_threads(parallelism)  // bounds concurrent Dilithium verifications
        .enable_all()
        .build()
        .unwrap()
        .block_on(run())
}
```

This setting is already applied in `scripts/dht_node.rs` (the Docker entry point) and
in all examples under `examples/`. If you embed the library in your own binary, apply
the same builder pattern instead of `#[tokio::main]`.

## Logging

AuthKademlia-RS uses the [`log`](https://docs.rs/log) crate with [`env_logger`](https://docs.rs/env_logger) as the backend. To enable debug output in your application:

```rust
env_logger::Builder::from_env(env_logger::Env::default().default_filter_or("info")).init();
```

When running tests or the binary directly, use the `RUST_LOG` environment variable:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test -- --nocapture
RUST_LOG=auth_kademlia_rs=trace cargo run --bin dht_node
```

## Python Bindings (experimental)

An optional Python extension can be built with [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin):

```bash
maturin develop --features python
```

> **Note:** The `python` feature builds a `cdylib` target via PyO3. Do **not** enable it in Rust-only deployments — the `cdylib` crate type changes linking behaviour and is unnecessary outside of Python extension builds. The Python bindings are experimental and not covered by the same stability guarantees as the Rust API.
